      <p>Over this past vacation, I spent about 12 hours volunteering at the local library. The chores were mostly menial drudgeries like pulling holds, putting away returns, and straightening shelves of books. Having said so, while my hands were
        busy, my eyes and hands wandered, and I noticed a couple of things that I want to share with you. Without further ado:<br /><br />Strats (Strategies)<br /><br />To minimize my workload, I developed a few techniques to make my jobs easier.
        First, to straighten and align books, the traditional strategy is to go up and down the rows pulling each and every book out to the edge of the shelf and stand it upright, then repeat with the neighboring book. The end result is an
        aesthetically-pleasing straight line of books, but the process is quite time-consuming, and not at all my style.<br /><br />I pulled all the books on a shelf so that they jutted out an inch or two, pushed the bookend so that pressure pushed
        all the books vertical. Finally, placing the palm of my hand so that it was half on the spine of the books and half jutted out into the space beneath, I pushed the books, 4 or 5 at a time, until my palm hit the shelf. The result? Perfectly
        aligned books. I ran a couple tests, and I'd say that my strategy probably worked 5 times as fast as the traditional method, and also sapped much less stamina making it far more sustainable.<br /><br />With pulling holds and putting away
        returns, organization was key. It would have been nice if all the patrons who took out books whose authors' last names started with A came in at 7 am and then B came at 8, but alas, the lists of holds and the stacks of returns came in a
        random order. Rather than running hither-thither like a headless chicken, I sat in a chair, spent 5 minutes organizing the books by section and number, and walked through the library once putting everything away with minimal physical
        exertion. Piece of cake!<br /><br />The Patrons<br /><br />Almost all of the library's patrons fit in one of three categories:<br /><br />Immigrants / ELL (English Language Learners)<br />Substitute Teachers<br />Parents with Young
        Children<br />I can't speak much to the whys and hows, but I have a few guesses. Immigrants often come from places where so much media isn't readily and freely available to them, moreover, I can speak to Indian culture in that no Indian would
        ever go buy a book for a one-time perusal if he/she could get it for free from the library! Extraneous spending for no good reason is a very American habit, and many people new to the country haven't developed it yet! ELL patrons are always
        very polite to the library staff, and treat the books gently and respectfully. Just the other day there was a man looking for Tamil books in the library. Unfortunately we didn't have any, but what struck me more than his request, was the
        courtesy with which he addressed the librarian.<br /><br />When I say substitute teachers, I'm referring to old people - seniors. More precisely, I'm referring to seniors who are still out and about in the community. These people are the life
        of the library! Whether it's Game of Thrones Season 2 on DVD or a murder mystery audiobook on CD, these patrons are the ones who make full use of the library and all of its resources - even the magazines!&nbsp;In this day and age, it's easy
        to see libraries as obsolete, but you shouldn't! Next time that one show isn't on Netflix, instead of grumbling and buying it on Amazon Prime for $17.99, think like an old person, and go to the library and get a copy!<br /><br />Finally,
        little kids. It makes me really happy to see other parents doing what my mom and dad did for me when I was little. All too often, I see kids who can't get off their mom or dad's phone, and wonder - is reading dead? Will the next generation
        come back to this archaic form of entertainment? It's nice to see that at least to some degree, the answer is yes. My guess for why the library, would be that books are moderately expensive, and a children's picture book is only good for a
        day's worth of reading. Rather than buy dozens of books that their kid will outgrow, parents are happy to take their kids to the library. Germs are a concern, especially for the younger kids - I remember my parents used to wipe the books down
        after we brought them home - but the benefits outweigh the costs like Godzilla outweighs King Kong! (Imagine a movie with those two. Who would even think of something that silly!)<br /><br />A couple other observations, I rarely see an adult
        in the library looking for books. Whether it's school or work, they always seem to have a lack of time to spend on reading. My advice - get a book. A comic, or short story, or a kids book - it doesn't matter. A lot of people, myself included,
        fill our time with Reddit, social media, TV and other nonsense. Then, at the end of the day, we grumble about how busy we are and how we never have time to relax. Grab a book and you'll be up till midnight in no time! Reading is addictive,
        but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We already have so many addictions in our lives, replacing a few of them with reading can't hurt. Also, the majority of adult/senior patrons are female. Is reading girly? If so, nobody ever told me! I
        have no answer on that one.<br /><br />The Dewey Decimal System<br /><br />Urgh. The Dewey Decimal System is a numerical organization system for books in the library. 0xx.xxx to 1xx.xxx is General Knowledge, 1xx.xxx to 2xx.xxx is Philosophy
        and Psychology, 2xx.xxx to 3xx.xxx is Religion, and so forth. Note that x's represent other digits, and there can be more digits after the decimal point. As you decrease the range, the specificity increases. 20x.xxx to 27x.xxx is
        Christianity. 273 is heresies in church history, etc. 273.4 is Controversies and Doctrinal Heresies of the Fourth Century, etc.<br /><br />I love it. I really do. It makes my life easier, makes the patrons' lives easier, makes the librarians'
        lives easier, essentially it's perfect. But at the same time... 331.892829225209712743090511. That's the Dewey Decimal number for - wait for it - Strikes by Tractor Operators working on Mining/Construction in Winnipeg, Canada from 2000 to
        2009. That's a bit of a hyperbole, as most numbers are only up to 4 digits after the decimal point, but still, sometimes the randomness amazes me. However, all in all 10/10 organizational system. The numerical nature has me hankering to build
        a program that can exactly pinpoint the location of a book - rack, shelf, and where it is on the shelf - given a proper organizational system (Row by 100s, Rack by Tens, Shelf by Ones, placement by Decimals, etc). The main problem is that the
        number of books in a given category is very random. For example, at the library, 641 is cookbooks, which we have dozens of, but 642 has so few books, I don't even know what it's for! I'll have to keep thinking about that one.<br /><br />This
        entire article has been a plug for your local library, but in case I was too subtle, if you haven't been to the library, go! If you use it, but only for books, check what else is available! If you use it for all that already, you know how
        much it's worth, so I'd encourage you, and everybody else, to volunteer! There's always work to be done, and besides the feel-good factor, it's a serene place to spend a few hours.<br /><br />A bonus puzzle:<br /><br />(Synonym for Suave) -
        (g) + (Under-cooked steak) - (e) + ('And' in Spanish) = Awesome!</p>
