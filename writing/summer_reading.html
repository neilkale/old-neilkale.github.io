      <p>A good writer must be an avid reader. Both to "learn from the past", and to inspire the future.<br /><br />With summer on its way, the long, sultry days of vacation loom ahead. It would be easy to while them away with hours spent playing
        video games or watching the TV. Without a strong alternative, I'm bound to fall into this very trap. Thus, my summer goal is born - I'm going to read at least 50 books by the time I head back to school.<br /><br />I've gotten through 3 so
        far, and the joy of reading is slowly, but surely, coming back to me. Reading for school is different. You go through the book, 1 or 2 chapters at a time, plodding slowly but surely to the end, preparing for the essay that awaits you. The
        school prepares the books like a sandwich, they cut the bread of the book into slices, and offer the condiments of worksheets, assignments, and class discussion to make each slice more palatable. Thus they feed us the classics, the greats,
        bite by bite. For many, reading stops here. To be honest, I find it hard to blame them. The school educates us remarkably well, and I completely support the way they teach English. Having said so, the nature of literature in the classroom
        setting is incomparable with reading solo.<br /><br />The excitement of staying up past bedtime flipping faster and faster as the grisly ensanguined killer gets one step closer to finding us; The desperation of seeing our impoverished brother
        struggle against his socioeconomic chains, only to be thwarted by life at every turn; The joy when our hero vanquishes the Villain, or the sorrow when he sacrifices himself to do so. When we read at school, we watch as if the scene takes
        place inside a bulletproof, emotion-proof snowglobe. The necessity of seeing the book from an objective, analytical standpoint prevents us from joining them in their world. On our own, we smash the snowglobe and become the
        characters.<br /><br />Often times, this makes the experience of reading a thousand times more impassioned and intimate. When reading the autobiography of a leader like Abdul Kalam, I can feel the passion and energy that drove him, I leave
        his world feeling rejuvenated and energized in my own life. But there is a flip side as well.<br /><br />When reading Guantanamo Diary, the diary of an innocent Muslim man, Mohamedou Ould Slahi, unjustly imprisoned in the Guantanamo prison
        facility, I was seething with rage and sadness. After reading about a particularly horrible session of psychological torture, I was wishing that the politicians who authorized these treatments, and the jailors who conducted them, could feel
        the pain and agony that they put Slahi through. That, for once, the waterboarding and freezer rooms could be turned on them. Upon leaving the world that day, I was deeply ashamed. As an outside viewer, it would have been easy for me to sit
        back and say "An eye for an eye only makes the world blind.", but I was no outside viewer by that point. Though I didn't join Slahi in that prison physically, the emotional tie I felt to him through his book, the accompanying anger at the
        total violation of basic human rights, and the thought that my country - my people - I - was a perpetrator of this gross crime was enough to have me questioning my until-that-point constant faith in the government. Guantanamo Diary was a book
        that had me up at night covered in cold sweat after dreaming that it was me who was in the prison as the jailor or the prisoner, perhaps as both. It was a book that I had to put down from time to time, to preserve my mental health. The pages
        of my local library's copy of Guantanamo Diary are still stained by salty tears. I wrote a letter to Slahi after finishing the book. His narrative was the most troubling piece I'd read up till that time, and I had grown deeply emotionally
        vested in his story. I told him that I supported him, that his story had moved me, and that I wished him well for the sake of his family and for the sake of the US government. Thankfully, Slahi was released in October of 2016, just a month
        after I finished his book. After almost 3 months of being consumed by an internal debate as to whether my allegiance was to the US government, extracting information from Guantanamo-incarcerated suspects who were actually terrorists, or to
        protecting the basic human rights of those who were innocent, this news brought me great happiness, then allowed me to finally move on.<br /><br />I tell this story to show the power of literature to evoke emotion. I went through sadness,
        anger, despair, misery, and, finally, happiness while reading Slahi's story. I pick this as an extreme example, but when you read solo, you're inside the snowglobe. There's no filter between the book and you, and this can make the experience
        more dimensional, but also more dangerous. I'm going to bear that in mind while downing my next 50 books. And while I'm going to enjoy their flavor, happy, exciting, or sad, and get a little intoxicated by their captivating narratives, I pray
        I won't get drunk on the tag-along emotions.<br /><br />But for better or for worse - it's going to snow.<br /><br />(Another post will follow, where I'll keep a track of the books, as we go)</p>
