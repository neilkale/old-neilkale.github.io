      <p>What is a tapestry? Technically, it's a particular form of woven art, defined by having no visible warp threads. Metaphorically, it is a story that can grow forever. A book has a limited number of pages. Once the back cover has been shut,
        it's over and gone. Of course, the author can write a sequel, but that's merely a continuation, not a part of the book itself. A tapestry, like life, continues on with no end, only a start and an ever-growing story from there on
        out.<br /><br />An ancient Greek myth lends itself to this metaphor. In the heavens, there reside three women. They are known as the&nbsp;moirai, or the fates. The&nbsp;moirai control the lives of every mortal. Clotho, the spinner, spins the
        thread of life. It is she who brings children into this world. Then there is Lachesis, the allotter. She is the one who measures each strand and twines it to form its path. Finally, Atropos, the cutter, cuts the thread of life. She is the
        bringer of death.<br /><br />Yet the story lies not in these three women and how they deal with the individual strings. Consider, that in this story, so much detail and attention goes into each thread. Imagine for a moment, the sheer
        complexity of the tapestry that would be created by the conglomeration of all these individual threads. If the vastness of space is great, the vastness of life is outright incomprehensible.<br /><br />The immediate question this situation
        posits upon you is simple in nature, but much more difficult to answer. "If the vastness of this 'tapestry' is so great, what could this site even cover?"<br /><br />In every tapestry, there is a rainbow of colors, but more importantly, in
        every color there is a spectrum of hues. There is red, and there is scarlet. There is blue, and there is cerulean. There is green, and there is emerald. There is yellow, and there is gold. For every color, there is one hue that stands out,
        one thread that sparkles brighter than the rest.<br /><br />In this blog, I have no intention of covering every strand. I am solely offering my take on the brightest hues. I will write stories from different perspectives, different threads of
        the tapestry. These stories won't necessarily be true or even accurate, but truthfully, no part of history is such. I am but one man, and my viewpoint will always be biased. I have not lived for 30 years in the savannah of Central Africa, if
        I choose to write from such a perspective, my story will definitely have inaccuracies.<br /><br />All I can promise, is that I will research each strand well, and try to provide an accurate image, as well as a tantalizing tale of a life that
        you have never lived, enough to prove that this tapestry is truly much bigger than any one of us.</p>
