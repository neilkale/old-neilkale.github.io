			<p> This is the content of the "About" page on my first blog, a Wordpress site titled "Sweat and Soliloquy" located at 'neilkale.wordpress.com'. All content has been ported to Sunny Side Up now, but the old site remains as an internet relic -
				forgotten, but never gone.</p>

			<p>I'm currently a freshman in high school.<br /><br />My academic interests include astronomy, physics, ancient cultures, and mathematics. Though this may seem eclectic, I can say without a doubt that my dream profession has remained the same
				since childhood - I will be the world's first ever astroarchaeologist.<br /><br />As Edward Teller once said, "The science of today is the technology of tomorrow." While purely scientific and mathematical discoveries have their place, the
				true magic is in converting them into technology that improves quality of life, helps people, or furthers mankind.<br /><br />Outside of purely scholarly activities, I enjoy singing, reading, and public speaking. I am president of my class as
				well as a social activist. As a human being, it is impossible for me to be wholly&nbsp;nonpartisan. Having said that, I try to see both sides of the card, and I hope this site will stay true to that.<br /><br />Sweat and Soliloquy is designed
				to provide a record of my life as well as compile my written&nbsp;works&nbsp;-&nbsp;The former&nbsp;part&nbsp;being the sweat&nbsp;of&nbsp;everyday life, and&nbsp;the latter being the&nbsp;soliloquy that rambles on endlessly
				within&nbsp;each&nbsp;of&nbsp;us. I hope that this site will be entertaining, insightful, or at least, unique, in its view of the world and portrayal of my life.<br /><br />Since you've read this far, it's probably safe to assume that you
				have a vested interest in me or I've died a horrible highly-publicized death and this blog is suddenly famous.&nbsp;With that happy thought in mind, thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay at Sweat and Soliloquy! If you like my
				work, feel free to share it, just please attribute credit back to this site.
