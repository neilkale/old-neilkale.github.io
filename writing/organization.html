      <p>It's Sunday evening, and after a productive day, I'm itching to hop on Battlefield and fool my brain into pepping me up with unwarranted adrenaline and bursts of endorphins. However, I'm playing the long game; I think the endorphins released
        by writing another piece on my website will far outnumber those I might accumulate over an hour of mediocre gaming. Also, whereas gaming endorphins are highly addictive, I have yet to get addicted to writing on my website. With that
        calculation in mind, I'm here to write.</p>
      <p>Today I want to talk about organization. It's a broad topic with generally positive connotations. When I personally think about organization, my mind splits - one side goes "It feels so good when everything's neat!", the other side stays
        firmly put and grumbles, "So much work! Does it really make a difference?"</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the first level of organization is physical - keeping things neat. Yesterday was my first free Saturday since the beginning of the year, so I decided to take the extra time to clean up my desk. I had a paper filing system in
        place from the beginning of the year, but I sort of trailed off after Christmas Break, and at this point it was sorely outdated. After lightening my backpack by about 10 pounds of ancient homework and exams, I started upon my desk. There
        wasn't much clutter, but I had to dust it off thoroughly. With all that done, I sat back down to study.</p>
      <p>Immediately, things felt the same. In fact, the first time that I registered any difference was when I sat down right now to write this article! Having this clean efficient work-space made me feel more inclined to do something productive.
      </p>
      <p>On some subconscious level, I think that untidiness and uncleanliness push us towards escapism. Cleaning up is an act of faith. The non-believers, myself included, seek solace in video games - alternate realities, or simply leaving my desk,
        and my studies, behind. I'm no prophet, but I'll offer up my experience as a true testimonial to organization. A clutter-free space is the way to a clutter-free mind.</p>
