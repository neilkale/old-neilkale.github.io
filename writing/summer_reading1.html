      <p><strong>1. When Breath Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi</strong></p>
      <p>Paul Kalanithi is one of my idols. A second-generation immigrant, he earned a Ph.D. in English Literature&nbsp;and&nbsp;an M.D., attending Stanford, Cambridge, and Yale. A true transcendentalist, he explored both the biological and spiritual
        nature of man in his quest for the meaning of life. Yet, all life must come to an end, and Kalanithi's came too soon. At 37, he faced the abyss. For him, it came in the guise of metastatic stage IV non-small-cell EGFR-positive lung cancer.
        Before he left us, he gave us one last gift -&nbsp;When Breath Becomes Air. Kalanithi has inspired me with his success, his courage, and his insight. I hope he will do the same to you.</p>
      <p>Paul was a groundbreaking neuroscientist, and a visionary philosopher, but above all, he was a writer.&nbsp;When Breath Becomes Air&nbsp;is a testimony to Kalanithi's literary genius, a nod to the intricacies of neuroscience, and a
        full-bodied embrace of human mortality. I have no higher compliments to give to his book, than to say it transcends that designation. More than a book,&nbsp;When Breath Becomes Air&nbsp;is a door into Kalanithi's mind. Open it! You'll thank
        me later.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Watchmen - Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&nbsp; : 'Who watches the watchmen?' " - Roman Poet Juvenal</p>
      <p>What if the superheroes weren't perfect? If the Hulk had cancer, Superman retired and started the "Superman" company, selling eponymous toys and merchandise, and Batman was a mentally-ill nobody, not a billionaire? What if vigilantes could
        grew old and died? If the government could capture and weaponize them?</p>
      <p>Watchmen&nbsp;explores the idea that superheroes and vigilantes are humans. That oftentimes, their minds are horribly screwed up, and this is what leads them to dress up in masks and capes and trounce around pretending to save the world.
        Moreover, that all they can really do, is pretend. The book also paints&nbsp;supervillains who don't dress up in masks and capes under alliterative guises, but rather in suits and ties, masquerading as politicians and businessmen.</p>
      <p>In essence,&nbsp;Watchmen&nbsp;closes the line between fiction and reality, opening up an entirely new universe. Written and illustrated in 1978,&nbsp;Watchmen&nbsp;is the graphic novel that changed a genre. Prior to its being written,
        superheroes were portrayed in comics as these perfect paragons of human society - Superman, the chiseled god who always saved the day ; Spiderman, the cool, super-smart teenager ; Batman, billionaire by day and caped crusader by night. These
        heroes were gods.</p>
      <p>In the modern day, superheroes aren't perfect. Superman got turned into a government tool, Batman is mentally-scarred, Spider-Man gets bullied at school, and turned into a blood-thirsty monster called Venom.</p>
      <p>Though it doesn't use the traditional cast from the DC universe, nor the Marvel universe,&nbsp;Watchmen&nbsp;changed the game for both of them. Possibly the greatest graphic novel of all time, I would recommend it to superhero fans,
        philosophers, and comic aficionados alike.</p>
      <p><strong>3. The Alchemist - Paolo Bacigalupi</strong></p>
      <p>A tale of "Sleeping Beauty" gone wrong, Bacigalupi transports us to the Middle-Eastern Medieval city of Khaim. In a world of magic and science, he weaves the tale of a man who tries desperately to save the world, only to meet the treacherous
        knife of bureaucracy and political skullduggery. Will he be able to overcome these obstacles, and save himself and his family before it's too late?</p>
      <p>I leave this overview rather short, because the book is less than 100 pages long, and you could probably read it faster than I could review it. The story is written in eloquent prose, and pushes a compelling narrative. If you're looking for
        a short novella to read on the bus/train to work, I can recommend this. If you're looking for something more substantial, feel free to pass on this.</p>
      <p>Note: This is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the uber-famous book,&nbsp;The Alchemist&nbsp;by Paolo&nbsp;Coelho.&nbsp;If I'm being perfectly honest, the reason I first picked this book up is because I thought it was by Coelho. I'll be reading that later this
        summer, so stay tuned!</p>
      <p><strong>4. Nightfall - Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg</strong></p>
      <p>The inherent goal of sci-fi is to take you to a world you've never seen before. Sometimes, this can be through advancements in technology - robots, time travel, spaceflight - however in "Nightfall", we are literally taken to another planet.
        It's identical to ours in every respect, except one - There are 6 suns. The planet, Kalgash, is bathed in perpetual daylight - but night is coming. There are so many aspects of our lives, that we take for granted -&nbsp; The environment, the
        atmosphere, the sun! Asimov and Silverberg throw us into a world with no day-night cycle, and show us just how much damage that could cause. This book stays true to the basic nature of sci-fi, and like a chocolate chip cookie, the simplicity
        is what makes it good.</p>
