			<p>The movie&nbsp;Gattaca&nbsp;is set in a dystopian future where DNA means everything and test-tube babies with perfect genomes are the norm. The main character, a natural-born man with genetic imperfections, has raised the ire of the
				government for trying to work at the space agency, a privilege reserved for the genetically perfect. Unfortunately for our protagonist, the government has a roster of every citizen's genome. In a world of handheld retina scanners and
				fingerprint identity matchers, he must resort to wild tricks to avoid getting caught. While&nbsp;Gattaca&nbsp;is far from real, it makes some interesting points. In a world where people readily give up their DNA to companies in exchange for a
				report detailing their ancestry, one must wonder where all that DNA goes. It certainly isn't being destroyed, and in a world of evergrowing technology, what could it eventually be used for? The following is a satirical piece written by me and
				my fellow classmate about what might happen if people keep being so open about their DNA.</p>

			<p>Dear Valued Customer,</p>
			<p> If you are receiving this message, your DNA may have been gently <br /> relocated in a slight network breach. We value your business, and ask <br /> for you to bear with us during this trying time. There is no need for <br /> alarm as
				DNA only lasts about 6.8 million years. You&rsquo;ll be off the <br /> records in no time. In the meantime, you may encounter a few minor <br /> anomalies. If you come home to find a long-lost identical twin replacing <br /> you, bear in mind
				that it may just be a clone. Never fear, there are <br /> procedures in place to deal with this event. For a small fee, we&rsquo;d be <br /> happy to incinerate your clone(s) and dispose of any remains. Of course, <br /> we would
				&ldquo;never&rdquo; make clones without your approval, just like we would <br /> &ldquo;never&rdquo; leak your data.</p>
			<p>If you are enrolled in the &ldquo;Baby+&rdquo; program, you may be concerned about <br /> the status of your child&rsquo;s genetic alterations. Here at Genesis, we love <br /> your precious little angel&rsquo;s DNA far more than you do. Of
				course, you <br /> don&rsquo;t know how much your sweetum&rsquo;s DNA sells for on the black market. We <br /> see that you&rsquo;ve ordered a purple-skinned, green-haired, 7-legged babe <br /> with two adorable little horns on his forehead.
				That&rsquo;s very <br /> fashion-forward of you; he&rsquo;ll be all the rage in another 10 years. As <br /> for soon-to-be parents who haven&rsquo;t yet enrolled in &ldquo;Baby+&rdquo;, your child <br /> is a blessing. Doesn&rsquo;t he
				deserves the best opportunities in life? Don&rsquo;t <br /> let your old-fashioned sense of ethics and morality deprive your child <br /> of a happy life. Society&rsquo;s opinion is irrelevant, all that matters is <br /> that your child is
				perfect to you, and here at Genesis, we&rsquo;re committed <br /> to supporting your needs.</p>
			<p>Now, for the good news, we estimate that almost 2% of you won&rsquo;t be <br /> affected by a genetic attack based on the DNA we auctioned off. We&rsquo;d <br /> like to remind you that this procedure is fully legal and described in <br />
				Terms and Services that you mindlessly signed, with the hope of finding <br /> your origins. Not to worry, this won&rsquo;t affect our operations. Thanks to <br /> your generous contributions, we have a few hundred billion samples of <br />
				DNA remaining in the US, which other countries are still bidding for.</p>
			<p>Valued customer, we note that you&rsquo;ve been with Genesis for over 10 <br /> years, since 2019. We would hate to lose your business due to this <br /> unfortunate event. Of course, if you should choose to leave the program, <br /> we
				still hold the full rights to your DNA, so there&rsquo;s really no point. <br /> Besides, your purchase of a genealogy kit has done far more than track <br /> down your fifteenth cousins. With this data, you can find out if you&rsquo;re
				<br /> more likely to get addicted to coffee, and still get exploited for more <br /> money. It&rsquo;s a win-win. On the bright side, now that your genetic data is <br /> out in the open, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about keeping it a
				secret <br /> anymore.</p>
			<p><br /> Here at Genesis, we are committed to human perfection. As the saying <br /> goes, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s CRISPR for lispers, and Cas9 for redesigns.&rdquo; Our company <br /> envisions a future where people can be their best self. One
				where people <br /> are born to soar across the sky. In fact, our work with bird genomes and <br /> chimeras may soon make that a reality. Also, immortality is coming soon <br /> - for those of you who can afford it.</p>
			<p>We promise that we aren&rsquo;t selling data directly to the foreign <br /> government, only their "unaffiliated&rdquo; companies. Don&rsquo;t be mistaken, <br /> we&rsquo;re motivated by greed, not politics. We&rsquo;ll be more careless
				with the <br /> future of humanity if you trust us this time. But don&rsquo;t worry, we know <br /> you will.</p>
			<p>For further information and assistance, please contact our customer <br /> service at 1-800-GENESIS.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			<p><br /> The Genesis Corporation</p>
