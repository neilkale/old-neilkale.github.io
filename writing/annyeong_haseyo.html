      <p>&ldquo;Tring-a-ling.&rdquo; A small bronze bell announced our arrival, as we opened the door leading into the warmly-lit parlor. My sister and mother rushed inside, but I lingered at the door for a moment. The cold winter wind which lashed at my back, and so readily invaded any other establishment up and down the block, seemed to retreat at the threshold, unsure of its place in this strange room. Here it was the other way around; the aromatic scent of soy sauce and loud clanking of pots and pans were invading the outside world. Though it had been my idea to give the local Korean restaurant a try, I, like the wind, felt a bit out of place. The room was jarringly different from any place I was used to, and the apathetic stare of the woman behind the counter wasn&rsquo;t making me any more comfortable. Still, I&rsquo;d come for bibimbap, and I wouldn&rsquo;t leave till I&rsquo;d had it. Steeling my nerves, I stepped over the sill, and let the door shut behind me with another &ldquo;Tring-a-ling.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Hello, welcome! Please have a seat.&rdquo; The words sailed smoothly from the woman behind the counter. The restaurant was just two rooms, the parlor being around 20 by 30 feet. In one corner sat a door-frame, no door. Considering that the clanging of pans seemed to originate from that direction, I assumed that the kitchen lay back there. Having taken the lay of the land, I turned to return the greeting, but the warm tone that I was sure I had heard just a second ago seemed like a hallucination considering the cold stare that was now confronting me. A feeble &ldquo;hello&rdquo; still escaped my lips - the conditioning of a thousand lectures in politeness wasn&rsquo;t so easily shaken. That said, I was thoroughly confused. I have been to restaurants that are all business, no fluff. We often stop at Pepe&rsquo;s Pizza in New Haven on the way up I-90, and I&rsquo;ve learned that Pepe&rsquo;s sells pizza not small talk. However, Pepe&rsquo;s is packed like a can of sardines whenever we get there. They&rsquo;re usually brusk, but only to speed up the transaction. The Korean restaurant, on the other hand, was almost empty. Where was the &ldquo;Boy, it&rsquo;s chilly out there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>We hadn&rsquo;t been directed to any particular table, so we hesitantly drifted towards one of the booths before settling in. While we waited to order, or rather for our next orders, I took a moment to examine the restaurant in greater detail. The wall across from us was sporadically plated in sheets of paper, each of which contained a special named in Korean, then English, with a price scribbled beneath it. Considering that many of the English names were merely transliterations of the Korean, I quickly scanned the wall for bibimbap. Not finding it, I started considering which word sounded tastier &ldquo;Bulgogi&rdquo; or &ldquo;Japchae.&rdquo; Of course, I could have just asked the server what those actually were, but I thought it might be better to just take my chances than to admit ignorance to somebody who already seemed to dislike me. To my relief, the server, same lady as before, brought over 3 clean but worn menus which contained descriptions of the dishes along with the names. To my delight, this menu did indeed contain bibimbap, so my quest was not in vain.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As we sat waiting for food, my eyes wandered over to the only other family sitting in the restaurant. It seemed to be a gathering of a couple and their in-laws. The husband&rsquo;s half of the family was Korean, and the wife&rsquo;s half was white. As I watched, the white parents seemed to be talking quite a lot, with the Korean father sitting back with a disapproving look in his eyes. When he finally did speak, it was in Korean, and the son had to translate. Considering his facial expression and demeanor, I was quite sure that he was scolding someone. To my astonishment, he had told a joke! Like a lightning bolt, it struck me that the man&rsquo;s inflection and facial expression wasn&rsquo;t new. It was the same one that I had seen when I first walked through the door.</p>
      <p>I had been looking at the situation through an American&rsquo;s red-white-and-blue-tinted glasses (As an aside, a South Korean&rsquo;s &ldquo;national&rdquo; glasses would also be red, white, and blue, so even this statement is America-centric). From the moment I entered the establishment, I had been receiving the epitome of Korean hospitality without even realizing. The lady behind the counter had not bothered us with forced chatter. She had brought tea along with the menus without us even asking, and she had been standing just a few meters away casually watching us. I had found that last bit somewhat frightening, but I now realized that she was simply waiting on us, ready to serve if we needed anything. The minute my tea finished, she had come over and filled it up, then resumed her position. This wasn&rsquo;t poor hospitality, it was first-class! In most restaurants, the servers will check on you once every 10 minutes or so, but here, service was always there! Who was I to complain about the hospitality? That&rsquo;s right, a clueless American.</p>
      <p>As a second-generation immigrant, I have always prided myself on not falling into the stereotypical American pitfall of being insensitive to other cultures. This experience greatly humbled me, by reminding me that there are always people who are different from me. If it had been a restaurant in India, and the man behind the counter had been pestering me every 6 seconds to try this or try that, I wouldn&rsquo;t have blinked twice. Sure, badgering customers isn&rsquo;t a common practice in the US, but in the Indian context, it was the norm. In fact, I would have felt odd to walk into a street-side shop in India and not be greeted by a coterie of salespeople suggesting various purchases! Similarly, in the Korean restaurant, I was in the Korean context. I finally understood what I had to do.</p>
      <p>When the server finally returned with the bibimbap, I turned to her and said somewhat bashfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;m saying this right, but Annyeong Haseyo?&rdquo; Turning to me, she smiled, this time most definitely not an illusion, and responded, &ldquo;Yes, that is right! Annyeong Haseyo!&rdquo; In India, I&rsquo;ve noticed that my parents always deal with the shopkeepers in Marathi or Hindi, depending on where we are. Most people feel more comfortable in their own language, so that&rsquo;s an easy way to connect with the person behind the counter. When we visit Boston&rsquo;s North End in the summer, hunting down the best cannolis and pizza, I always open with &lsquo;Buongiorno!&rsquo; and close with &lsquo;Grazie!&rsquo; Even though I don&rsquo;t know the whole language, it shows that I care about and respect their culture. The Korean restaurant was no different. The server brought her culture to the counter, and I brought mine. By saying hello in Korean, I hope I conveyed my respect for her culture, and, by proxy, for the hospitality that I received that day.</p>
      <p>So, here&rsquo;s my advice for facing unfamiliar cultures. Learn the language. Understand the inherent biases in your expectations. And be open to learning! Our world is moving towards a global community, and that shift starts within each of us. One hundred years ago, a resident in my town would have been hard-pressed to find a way to experience Korean culture. Now, within 5 miles of my home, I can encounter Korean hospitality, learn Indian dance, go to a Spanish church, and take lessons in West African drumming. By embracing these opportunities, we can learn more about each other and about ourselves. Globalization starts here with you and me.</p>
      <p>So, reader, I now say to you, &ldquo;Annyeong Haseyo! &rdquo; Pass it on.</p>
