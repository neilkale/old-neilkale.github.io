      <p><strong>1.&nbsp;Into Tibet&nbsp;- Thomas Laird</strong></p>
      <p>An action thriller based in fact.&nbsp;"Into Tibet" tells the story of the first CIA agent killed in action, and delves into the secret nuclear war of the desolate steppes of Kazakhstan and Mongolia.</p>
      <p>There's only one problem - The book is unbelievably&nbsp;boring. Laird does his best to spin a story around Mackiernan and his adventures, but when it comes down to it, his book fails, both as a thriller and as a non-fiction.</p>
      <p>The knowledge contained in the book is completely inane and dull. After all, who really cares about the secret diplomatic relations between the Kazakh sheep-herders and undercover CIA agents.</p>
      <p>I recommend this book, if, and only if, you live in Tibet or Kazakhstan, you are part of the CIA, or your name is the Dalai Lama. If not, please don't waste your time.</p>
      <p><strong>2.&nbsp;Incognito: The Secret Lives of Our Brains&nbsp;- David Eagleman</strong></p>
      <p>Have you ever wondered how our brains work? 'Think' about it, how are your eyes sending the symbols on this page into your head. How are you deciphering these symbols and determining a message?</p>
      <p>If you don't care, don't bother reading this book, but if these questions pique your interest, like they pique mine, I strongly recommend this book.</p>
      <p>Incognito&nbsp;covers many of the important and interesting functions of the brain without getting stuck in the dense muck of medical jargon and long-winded latin names.&nbsp;After having read through two college-level neuroscience textbooks
        in preparation for the State Neuroscience Bee (A little brag: I came 3rd out of over 100 competitors), I can say with a bit of authority that this is a&nbsp;very good thing.&nbsp;Oftentimes, medical nonfiction gets very dry and boring, but
        this book manages to stay sprucy and spry throughout.</p>
      <p>All in all, this book isn't light reading, but it isn't a medical textbook either. If you're looking to learn something new, or have even a piddling interest in neuroscience, I can guarantee you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for
        something fast-paced or plot-based, this book is not for you. Personally, I loved it, but in case my undying love for "When Breath Becomes Air" and my humble-brag in the last paragraph didn't give it away, I'm a huge brain buff, so take my
        word with a grain of salt.</p>
      <p><strong>3.&nbsp;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&nbsp;- Douglas Adams</strong></p>
      <p>SCIFI-SCIFI-SCIFI-SCIFI-SCIFI-SCIFI-SCIFI.</p>
      <p>There. I could literally end this review right here, because if you like Sci-Fi, you like this book, and if you don't, turn away, things are going to get ugly!</p>
      <p>Still with me? Well, if you are, then I'm going to tell you flat-out, The&nbsp;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&nbsp;is the funniest, quirkiest, and most absurd sci-fi novel you'll ever read. It makes absolutely no sense, and that's exactly
        why it's so lovable.</p>
      <p>The meaning of life, the universe, and everything?&nbsp;42. I love, love, love this book, not because it has a wonderful plot or anything, but because it makes fun of every sci-fi trope while taking you on an acid trip through the galaxy.
        Reading this book is a lackadaisical psychedelic experience that any sci-fi lover should experience at least once in his/her life.</p>
      <p>There's also a movie from 2006 or 2008 based on this book. I don't know if it's any good as I haven't seen it, but feel free to watch it and let me know.</p>
      <p><strong>4.&nbsp;The Punch Escrow&nbsp;- Tal M. Klein</strong></p>
      <p>If "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is the fiction part of sci-fi,&nbsp;The Punch Escrow&nbsp;is hard science. (And yes, I just used "quotation marks" and and&nbsp;underline&nbsp;to denote book titles in the same sentence. Get over
        it.) Klein has created a world where teleportation is possible, genetically-modified mosquitoes are cleaning up the environment, and everyone has Google Glasses integrated into their head. Moreover, he's studiously worked to justify his
        creation through a mixture of real quantum physics and made-up technological jargon (Punch Escrow). Though it is fascinating at times to see the "real-life science" behind his ideas, after a while it gets quite tiresome. Sci-fi and science
        are two very different animals, and Klein can't quite figure out which one he prefers.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, all the "real science" is in the footnotes, so you can easily skip over it, and "The Punch Escrow" is a great action sci-fi novel in it's own right. If you're looking for a heavier, "sciency" sci-fi, you should really check it
        out.</p>
      <p><strong>5.&nbsp;Turn Right at Macchu Picchu&nbsp;- Mark Adams</strong></p>
      <p>Every year, in an effort to propagate literacy and a love for reading, our school has us read one book over the summer. This is somewhat pointless, as many teachers themselves don't read the book, and there is no real incentive for students
        to do so, as they're never tested on the content. Many public schools in Massachusetts and the US at large have inordinately large libraries. While once an important resource for research and recreation, they are now relics of a bygone
        pre-internet era, they are now rarely, if ever, used, especially in tech-savvy schools like mine, where every student has a laptop. The sad truth is that this notebook-sized device contains infinitely more information and entertainment than
        all the libraries in the world, in the form of the internet.</p>
      <p>I digress, for while technology has its benefits, reading a book, flipping page after page, and using your own imagination and creativity to create a world out of the ink has a joy of its own - especially if the book is anything
        like&nbsp;Turn Right at Macchu Picchu.</p>
      <p>I've always wanted to go to Macchu Picchu, but this book made me realize how much I wanted it! Mark Adams, a classic city boy with a newspaper travel column, writes about his misadventures through Peru with just the right details to make you
        fear and respect the fantastic country, but also enchant you with the idea of stumbling through the rivulet-ridden rainforests, gilded glaciers, and monolithic mountains of the mystical Land of the Incas.</p>
      <p>If you enjoy historical fiction or traveling, or you're just struck with a sudden case of wanderlust, try the book, and you may find yourself buying plane tickets to Peru before you know it!</p>
      <p><strong>6.&nbsp;Sniper: A Novel&nbsp;- Nicolai Lilin&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>At 18 years old, Nicolai Lilin was drafted into the Russian army and sent to Chechnya,a fiercely contested region of Russia, on what was meant to be a suicide mission. He survived the 2-year draft through luck, skill, and killer instinct.
        This is his story.</p>
      <p>This book is an action-thriller at heart, as Lilin only lends passing remarks to the politics of the war. However, I gleaned that he is decidedly&nbsp;anti-American, as he believes America is funding the rebels fighting against
        him,&nbsp;and&nbsp;he's rather&nbsp;anti-Russian, as he believes the bureaucrats and military officials who run the country are war-profiteers.</p>
      <p>Oftentimes, we forget that the soldiers fighting against our nation are also human. Like Lilin, they may only have a vague idea as to&nbsp;why&nbsp;they are fighting.&nbsp;As an American, I had my qualms with Lilin's political views, but
        reading this book taught me an important lesson - There are no winners in war.</p>
      <p><strong>7.&nbsp;Star Wars: Bloodline&nbsp;-&nbsp;Claudia Gray</strong></p>
      <p>Full Disclosure: I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so I had to love this book.</p>
      <p>In short, this is a really well-written story, even without the Star Wars elements. If you're a fan of the movies, you'll absolutely love this book, but if not, it's a good book, but not worth your time.</p>
      <p>The book centers around Leia in between "The Return of the Jedi" and "The Force Awakens". Personally, I was really confused by the jump between the two, since at the end of "The Return of the Jedi" everybody's partying on Endor, and then at
        the beginning of "The Force Awakens", we've suddenly got a huge evil organization called the First Order and total destabilization of the New Republic. The jump makes zero sense, but&nbsp;Star Wars: Bloodline&nbsp;flawlessly bridges this gap.
      </p>
      <p>Bonus: We get to see Leia and Han together!</p>
      <p><strong>8. The Running Man&nbsp;- Stephen King</strong></p>
      <p>One of King's earliest stories, this book is a monument to his ability to create a grim dystopia filled with grimy residents, and thoroughly immerse his reader in the misery of it all.</p>
      <p>This book is by no means a happy or light read. It strikes at the heart of the human condition - inescapable poverty, insurmountable social inequity, and above all, the clawing, unfaltering will of the human soul to survive through it all.
      </p>
      <p>In the book, a poor man named Ben Richards is selected to participate in a peculiar game show called&nbsp;"The Running Man". Without giving too much away, I can only say that Richards has the chance to win 1 billion dollars and escape
        poverty forever. However, if he doesn't win, he will die. Or rather, if he dies, he doesn't win.</p>
      <p>If you need a book to pick up on your daily commute (Audiobooks are the best!), or you like horror, but lack the tenacity to plow through his heavier novels (Personally, I couldn't make it even half-way through&nbsp;The Shining), I highly
        recommend&nbsp;The Running Man.</p>
