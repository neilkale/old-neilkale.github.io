		<p>A school initiative encouraged us to live without electronics for 24 hours. Here, I discuss my feelings about the self-imposed blackout.</p>
		<hr>
		</hr>
		<p>Sunday starts with self-realization. At 5 am, I stumble downstairs to switch off my alarm clock. Blanket in hand, I contemplate another hour or two of indolently lazing on the couch, but I decide against it. Instead, I&rsquo;ll be productive
			and crank out some AP prep before breakfast, I think as I sit down in front of my computer - in the parlor adjacent to the kitchen. &ldquo;Click, whir. Whir. Whir. Beep. Beep-Beep.&rdquo; The computer&rsquo;s (Barry&rsquo;s) start-up noises
			fill the room. My mom is the true early morning powerhouse, who gets us out of bed and into school, but on days like this, for an hour or two, it&rsquo;s just me and Barry. Is it bad that I personified my computer? I spend just about as much
			time with him (it?) as I do with real people. And don&rsquo;t people personify their cars? Personally, I think it&rsquo;s the same thing. As the monitor lights my face in a sapphire blue glow, my fingers instinctively reach for the keyboard,
			soaring towards the keys like homing missiles with preset paths. &ldquo;Clack, clack, clack, clack.&rdquo; (Note: The number of clacks has been changed for privacy reasons) The password is in, and we are a go for launch! &ldquo;Click&rdquo;.
			Ah. As the browser window pops open, I can feel an internal tension subside. It&rsquo;s as if I was afraid of sitting alone in front of this seemingly empty black obelisk, as the strange pre-dawn glow cut through the black night. Now, with a
			friendly white glare searing into my eyes, the world seems a little less frightening. The promise of funny videos and webcomics has the cursor sliding towards &lsquo;Reddit&rsquo;, my go-to social media page, wavering only briefly to consider
			the possibility of studying like I actually came down to do. Just as my finger brings down the gavel, sentencing me to an hour and a half of totally wasted time, my eyes finally settle on the red Post-It tacked to the side of my desk.
			&ldquo;SUNDAY â…š: UNPLUG!!!&rdquo;<br /><br />I&rsquo;m not proud to admit it, but my first thought was, If I don&rsquo;t do it, no one&rsquo;s ever going to find out. So&hellip; However, I can&rsquo;t say whether I&rsquo;m unwaveringly
			scrupulous, but I am unwaveringly curious; I genuinely wanted to know how this would turn out. Needless to say, I couldn&rsquo;t take it. After about 30 minutes of poring through Bio notes, pacing, muttering to myself, pulling at my hair, and
			glancing longingly at my desk and the now-silent Barry, I could see my wit&rsquo;s end approaching - fast. The night had dissipated, and been replaced by a seemingly endless swath of gray clouds. As I stepped outside to clear my head, the icy
			drizzle washed away any hopes of killing the day outside. However, I wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up. To start with, I woke up everybody in the house by blasting some Martin Garrix on the Google Home. (OK, yes, it&rsquo;s technology, but at
			this point, it&rsquo;s basically a glorified grammophone!) While I was having my one man EDM dance party in the kitchen (And attempting to do the dishes at the same time), my sister decided to make a case for breakfast at Christina&rsquo;s.
			Usually, I&rsquo;m a two fried eggs and ready-to-go kind of guy when it comes to breakfast, but at that point, I just wanted to get away from Barry&rsquo;s cold dead stare. With my added support, and since we were all up at a reasonable hour,
			we left for Christina&rsquo;s. From there on out till well past dusk that day, I managed to avoid even glancing at Barry. No, I didn&rsquo;t sit at Christina&rsquo;s all day! We came home, planted a tree, cleaned my sister&rsquo;s room, put
			the robot slave (Roomba) to work (Note that I didn&rsquo;t turn it on, or directly interact with it in any way, so technically - no technology!) With some housework as well as a triple-egg omelette and a blueberry muffin under my belt, we
			headed off to the Science Museum. It was odd that though this was my third visit this year, this was the first time I&rsquo;d noticed to abundance of technology everywhere. From exhibits on quantum computing to a hall of electrical
			inventions, I was surrounded! Eventually, I fled into the one place where technology has yet to pervade - nature. After a few hours of imitating mountain lion snarls and imagining riding a moose, we headed home. Whereas most Sunday evenings
			are a time for peaceful introspection through fast-paced adrenaline-pumping video games, I spent the evening playing cards with my sister and facing off in a high-stakes drawing contest. I didn&rsquo;t even notice Barry till around 9:30 when
			I headed up to bed. On Sunday, I realized that I don&rsquo;t need online companionship. I have just what I need right here with me.
