			<p>In class, we're reading Whistling Vivaldi by Claude M. Steele. It's a great book, and it got me thinking about my own experiences, and how I've dealt with stereotype in my life. I hope you enjoy my story.</p>
			<hr>
			</hr>
			<p>In his book, Whistling Vivaldi, Claude Steele opens with a story about himself as black 8-year old in 1950&rsquo;s Chicagoland (1), and another about a college student who was &ldquo;one of only two whites in an African-American political
				science class.&rdquo; (2) Both him and the college student were suddenly conscious of their identity. In his own case, Steele realized that he would only be allowed to swim at the community pool on Wednesdays, simply because he was black (2).
				Moreover, since this identity was tied to the color of his skin, there was no way to hide from it. But what if you could hide your identity? What if it wasn&rsquo;t something that showed in the color of your skin, hair, or eyes, but instead
				something internal that could be concealed to avoid the associated &ldquo;identity contingencies&rdquo;. Then, you&rsquo;re faced with a choice &ndash; be yourself and face the consequences, or lie low and conform. As I will now tell you, I
				had to make that choice at a very young age.</p>
			<p>On the last day of Kindergarten at the First Baptist Christian school, my teacher, Mrs. Hadden, asked the class a simple question: &ldquo;Who believes in God?&rdquo; Every hand in the room shot up &ndash; except one. Sitting in the back row,
				that one little boy was very confused. The other Indian in class, a girl named Aarya, was urging me to put my hand up with frantic under-the-desk gestures. For what seemed like an eternity, I sat there indecisive. Finally, with all 24 pairs
				of eyes trained on me, I slowly raised my hand. Maybe it was the tingle crawling up my back, or the fact that I had a crush on Aarya. Whatever the reason, the pressure got to me, even before I knew what peer pressure was, and I lied simply to
				avoid being &ldquo;different&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t a total lie. A kid believes in a lot of things. Up until 5th grade, every time I went to fetch the mail, I was half-sure that a letter from Hogwarts would be waiting for me. As a younger kid, you learn that not
				everything you believe in will really exist. Moreover, you learn that it&rsquo;s OK to believe in something that doesn&rsquo;t exist. My parents never took me to temple, but there were other ways that religion crept into my life. My
				mother&rsquo;s lullabies would tell the story of Rama. When she was busy, I would listen to a musical rendition of the Geet Ramayan instead. My best friend and I would hop from couch to couch wielding plastic swords and maces pretending to be
				the Pandavas fighting the imaginary Kauravas, reenacting battles from the Mahabharat. It was never religion to me, just stories - amazing, wonderful stories of heroes, gods, and demons. Christian school was the same. They were simply more
				stories. If someone had told me a story about Jesus fighting Hanuman, I would have been no more surprised than to hear that Harry Potter had bested Percy Jackson. When my teacher asked whether I believed in God, the first question that popped
				into my mind was, &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When my teacher held me back after class to ask about my hesitation, I readily asked her my question. I&rsquo;ve never seen rage in a kindergarten teacher&rsquo;s eyes, but this was as close as it gets. &ldquo;Because they aren&rsquo;t
				real!&rdquo; Now, I was intrigued. The idea of &ldquo;realness&rdquo; had never affected my beliefs. I asked her how she knew. &ldquo;Because they aren&rsquo;t in the bible.&rdquo; Who wrote the Bible? At this point, I was half-way to the
				principal&rsquo;s office. Apparently, the religion I&rsquo;d learned at home was less meaningful than the religion I&rsquo;d learned at school, because it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;real&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Thankfully, my kindergarten teacher was no cult leader, and between my own disbelief and my parent&rsquo;s reassurances that there was no need to base faith on realness, I&rsquo;ve stayed religiously open. When people ask me whether
				I&rsquo;m Hindu, I answer, &ldquo;Only in temple&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not entirely true. When I don traditional grab and head to family gatherings, or when I fly down to India for festival season, I embrace Hinduism fully. When I&rsquo;m
				sitting in the Congregational Church reading aloud a story about Jonah and the Whale, I&rsquo;m at one with the &ldquo;true God&rdquo;. If I was ever allowed into Mecca, to walk rounds about the Kaaba, I would be at one with Allah. The name
				changes, yet the spirit remains the same.</p>
			<p>In my opinion, a religious order based on &ldquo;realness&rdquo; has no merit. Instead of arguing the inarguable, my teacher could have counteracted my belief in Hindu gods by explaining that my &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; gods were unnecessarily
				violent, whereas Jesus was peaceful and thus better. Of course, I could have counteracted by offering numerous occasions where God had acted in a sadistic manner, such as forcing Abraham to offer his son as a sacrifice (at the last second,
				God says something to the effect of &ldquo;just kidding&rdquo;). Mrs. Hadden could have taught me that this sacrifice was needed to ensure Abraham&rsquo;s faith and ensure that he could be trusted to take the Israelites to the promised land.
				I could have returned that the violence of the Mahabharat was equally justified and so on.</p>
			<p>Theological discussions of this type &ndash; discussing beliefs and stories &ndash; are powerful. They lead to insightful discoveries about our own religions and those of others. These discussions can lead to positive collaboration rather
				than the oh-so-often stifling of one belief by the proponents of another. For such discussions to take place, we need a few changes.</p>
			<p>First, put stories and beliefs before &ldquo;realness&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve attended several sermons over the years &ndash; not many, but enough to know that many pastors spend a long time expounding the &ldquo;realness&rdquo; of god, rather
				than discussing stories and beliefs. Even when stories and beliefs are discussed, it is always with the underlying assumption that their God must be &ldquo;real&rdquo;. Without &ldquo;realness&rdquo;, it seems as if the whole religion will
				fall apart. Let the stories and beliefs speak for themselves!</p>
			<p>Second, we should learn each other&rsquo;s stories, or at least be open to the prospect. I was lucky enough to learn Hindu stories at home, and Christian stories at school, so I&rsquo;ve been exposed to multiple perspectives. Ms. Wildfong
				told us how important it is to know another language in order to understand how people think in other parts of the world. Perhaps knowing another religion &ndash; not just knowing of it &ndash; will allow us to better understand each other as
				well.</p>
			<p>Religion is beautiful. Its ability to unify billions of people under one banner is one-of-a-kind. Eliminating &ldquo;religious order&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean eliminating religion, but rather embracing it. Let us embrace religions of all
				people. Learn them well, and then amend our own beliefs. In the past, religions have met in bloody clashes based on &ldquo;realness&rdquo;. Someday, I hope we will overcome this fascination with &ldquo;realness&rdquo;. From that day on, the
				points where old religions meet will be the points where new religions sprout. Let us turn the battlefields of yore where religions and their believers lie dying into gardens where new religions and believers may grow. Let us crusade for
				knowledge, not death.</p>
