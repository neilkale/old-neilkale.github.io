      <p>&nbsp; &ldquo;The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity&rdquo;. As his words show, Bob Marley deeply valued integrity. And with good reason! Integrity is what defines a good person. We admire it in
        others and hope to see in ourselves. The question is - what does integrity look like? By definition, it&rsquo;s a set of personal characteristics possessed by those with strong morals. And though we value many different characteristics, only
        some of those exhibit integrity. On one hand, we value strength, intelligence, beauty, and power. However, we place just as much value on perseverance, bravery, kindness, and compassion. It&rsquo;s this latter category that defines integrity,
        for integrity isn&rsquo;t about your brains, your beauty, or your brawn - integrity is all about heart.</p>
      <p>The parable of the Good Samaritan is a Biblical tale about a man who stops to help an injured stranger lying in his path. The story, or some version of it, is universally known. The appeal comes from the moral it teaches - &ldquo;Love thy
        neighbor as thyself&rdquo;. An essential part of integrity is empathizing and caring for others, even total strangers. One modern-day tale of the Good Samaritan unfolded on 9/11. The first responders - including the police officers, marines,
        firefighters, and EMTs - exhibited tremendous integrity. These individuals risked their lives time and time again in their search for survivors. Many off-duty officers came anyway because they felt it was their moral duty to help their fellow
        Americans. After the attacks, Manhattan had to be fully evacuated. It couldn&rsquo;t have been done without the 800 civilian sailors who helped transport the endless hordes of New Yorkers to safer pastures. These sailors exhibited integrity,
        for they went out of their way and into danger to help those in need. Integrity looks like the Good Samaritans of the world, people who empathize and care for everyone, no matter who or how they are.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The traits of perseverance, bravery, and courage are hallmarks of integrity. While we traditionally associate them with physical strength, the true test of these traits is not a test of the body, but a test of the soul - a test of having the
        perseverance to stick to your morals, the courage to act on them, and the bravery to disregard the naysayers. Martin Luther King Jr. is an iconic example of having firm morals and the integrity to stick to them. Reverend King morally opposed
        the policy of segregation. And though he was arrested, threatened, and harassed time and time again, he bravely pressed on. He had the courage to speak in front of thousands and the perseverance to do so for years. When MLK stood up for
        equality, thousands of people stood up with him. Some stood up by marching. Some stood up by going to a whites-only school. Rosa Parks stood up - by sitting down! To do as MLK suggested, to &ldquo;[break] an unjust law&hellip; openly,
        lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty&rdquo; took integrity. Just until this year, in Saudi Arabia, driving was illegal for women. Many Saudi women such as Manal-al-Sharif and Samar Badawi morally opposed this restriction.
        They had the courage to drive anyway, the bravery to sit through hours of interrogation, and the perseverance to do it again, and again, and again until the law was beat. What does integrity look like? It looks like perseverance, bravery, and
        courage in the face of tremendous adversity.</p>
      <p>The word &ldquo;Integrity&rdquo; comes from the Latin word integer meaning whole, or undivided. Consequently, &ldquo;community&rdquo;, &ldquo;unity&rdquo; and &ldquo;teamwork&rdquo; are vital to integrity. These are the qualities that allow
        many people of integrity to work together. Volunteer organizations like Lions Club, Red Cross, and UNICEF epitomize this synergy of integrity, where the organization as a whole is stronger than the sum of its parts. At the most basic level,
        volunteers are integrity donors. They lend their moral conviction to a cause, persevere and care for that cause, and together they achieve great things for the community. Our town's public spaces wouldn&rsquo;t look nearly as nice without the
        tireless efforts of the Garden Club. They&rsquo;re a small organization with a couple dozen members, but together they keep our town gorgeous and they do it for free. Spending your Sunday toiling in the Sun next to West Main Street -
        that&rsquo;s integrity. Integrity can be seen in any volunteer, and on the flip side, volunteering requires integrity. Without collaboration and teamwork, you can&rsquo;t work effectively with others. Without a sense of community, you
        won&rsquo;t even want to help. Whenever you see good collaboration, teamwork, and community, you&rsquo;re looking at integrity.</p>
      <p> Lastly, I'd like to talk about how we can further enhance integrity in our own lives. There are some key actions and behaviors that anyone with integrity has got to do from you or me to Martin Luther King Jr. First, be yourself.
        It&rsquo;s cliche, it&rsquo;s overused, but it&rsquo;s true. Integrity is about staying true to your personal moral beliefs whatever they may be. By acting like someone else, we diminish our courage and lack bravery. It&rsquo;s a disservice
        to the powerful, unique person that you truly are. By staying true to yourself and your beliefs, you will have more courage and conviction behind your actions. Moreover, we&rsquo;re not perfect, and if we try to pretend we are, we lose
        empathy and compassion. By accepting our own flaws, we become better at accepting other people&rsquo;s imperfections. Second, be honest. A basic tenet of integrity is having the courage to do the right thing regardless of the consequences,
        and the bravery to face said consequences. By telling the truth, we confront our moral shortcomings, and we can work to fix them. By lying, we let our problems fester and rot becoming worse and worse over time. Honestly, just tell the truth.
        Finally, reflect. Integrity is a dynamic concept. One of its hallmarks is that it keeps improving over time. By reflecting on our actions, habits, words, and even our thoughts, we can find ways to improve. Empathy, caring, and compassion.
        Perseverance, courage, and bravery. And finally, individuality, honesty, and self-reflection. These traits reveal integrity, for, without integrity, you can&rsquo;t have any of them.&nbsp; In the end, integrity is the single trait that
        defines who you are. And the only person who can strengthen your integrity is you. Thank you.</p>
