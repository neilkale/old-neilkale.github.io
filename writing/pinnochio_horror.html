      <p>I've got about 5 minutes until the bus comes, so I figured I'd make up a story really fast.<br /><br />Once upon a time, many years ago, there lived a a poor carpenter named Giuseppe. (1 min In his free time, Giuseppe loved to whittle. His
        house was a menagerie filled with thousands of wooden birds, (2 min) each one unique and special in its own way. (3 min)<br /><br />Well, this is starting to stagnate - so let's stir it up!<br /><br />No one suspected Giuseppe's dark secret.
        His backyard was filled with bird feeders, yet not a bird was in sight. Only (4 min) a couple of wooden carvings, each a life-like replica of a bird! For many years, his collection grew. Sometimes the birds would stop coming, and he would
        have to move to another town, but he kept working, tirelessly, until one day he wanted more.(5 min, but now I have to finish this!)<br /><br />That fateful day, a small boy walked into his store awestruck by the sculptures surrounding him.
        His name was Pinocchio. (6 min)<br /><br />And fin! A 5, OK - 6 minute story! As for the horror aspect, I blame Jordan Peele. Seeing 'Us' has stirred up the darker side of story-telling in me.<br /><br />Off to the bus!</p>
