      <p>Foreword: I wrote the following for a speech competition, and felt it to be worth sharing with you guys. The topic of the competition was "The Impact of Volunteerism". Though the essay was for a competition, I definitely share the feelings
        that I expressed through the piece. Hopefully, you share my sentiment and will volunteer in some way this year.</p>
      <p>Happy Reading!</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&ldquo;The impact of volunteerism&rdquo; &nbsp;- what does that mean? It&rsquo;s impossible to understand this topic, without first understanding the volunteer. Of course, there&rsquo;s the dictionary definition, &ldquo;An individual who
        offers services for no financial gain&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not enough to merely understand the actions that define a volunteer, one must understand the intent behind them. As such, rather than asking, &ldquo;Who is a volunteer?&rdquo;, we
        should be asking, &ldquo;Why do we volunteer?&rdquo;. Naturally, I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone. There are countless reasons to volunteer, but if I were to venture a guess, it would seem that many volunteers are just people who want to do
        good. Thus, the &ldquo;Impact of Volunteerism&rdquo;, can be rephrased as, &ldquo;The Impact of Do-Gooders&rdquo;, and instantaneously, our question becomes much simpler to answer. What is the impact of good people?</p>
      <p>Throughout history, countless amazing things have been achieved by volunteers. Take, for example, the Benedictine monks who devoted their lives to keeping the vast knowledge of the Greeks and Romans alive through the Dark Ages! Look at the
        Minutemen of the Revolutionary War, unpaid volunteers who risked life-and-limb to free America. Consider for a moment, Florence Nightingale, &ldquo;The Lady with the Lamp&rdquo;, whose volunteer work during the Crimean War drastically
        improved treatment for injured soldiers on the front lines and founded the field of professional nursing. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a common misconception that the pyramids were built by slaves. In recent times, egyptologist, Zahi Hawass, the
        former Chief Inspector of the Giza Pyramid Plateau, has put forth the theory that the pyramids were not built by slaves, but by volunteers! Even Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, was a volunteer. Dr. Salk never patented his polio
        vaccine, so that it would be more readily available to all. Because he volunteered his work for free, yearly polio infections have come down to about 40 cases, a 99.99% decrease from the 350,000 that were reported in 1988.</p>
      <p>Volunteers built a wonder of the world. Volunteers have preserved ancient knowledge. Volunteers have won wars and changed the course of history. Volunteers have founded new disciplines, and even cured humanity of a disease. Arguably, the
        greatest deeds simply can&rsquo;t be done solely for a paycheck. In order to make a lasting mark, to impact the world, one must be a volunteer. Someone working, not for money, but because they believe in the righteousness of their cause.</p>
      <p>In the modern day, it&rsquo;s not one volunteer, or even a single group of volunteers, that embodies volunteerism - It&rsquo;s the ever-present spirit of making the world a better place. Throughout our communities, our schools, and our
        homes, there is a sense of collaboration towards service. Because of this, we now see tens, if not hundreds, of organizations, all focused on supporting a cause through volunteerism. Take the members of the International Red Cross, who
        provide disaster relief and emergency assistance to people around the world. After Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck, they were there on the scene, helping communities to rebuild and displaced people to survive. Consider Lions Club
        International, whose 1.4 million members are dedicated to helping others on dozens of different fronts, not to mention their work towards preventing diabetes and helping those with vision or hearing impairment. Doctors Without Borders is
        another noteworthy example. Their staff, 90% of whom are volunteers, provide free medical aid to people in over 70 countries, especially those wrought in conflict or afflicted with poor sanitary conditions. All of these organizations have the
        power to bring people together - to forge new bonds and reinforce existing ones. Moreover, all the people brought together by these organizations are dedicated to service, and determined to make a difference. This makes the impact of their
        work and the message they spread so much stronger.</p>
      <p>In addition to these organizations, there are hundreds of visionaries worldwide who are impacting the world through their volunteer work. These individuals have found issues in their lives that they feel strongly about, and are working to
        make their vision a reality. Consider Pen Farthing, the founder of Nowzad Dogs, an organization that strives to reunite servicemen with dogs and cats they might have befriended during their time abroad. Take Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani
        activist, working to promote girls&rsquo; education around the world. As Chad Pregracke, a fisherman working to clean up America&rsquo;s river systems, put it, &ldquo;All you have to do is change your world. That is how the world
        changes!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Furthermore, lest we forget, even those who aren&rsquo;t formally part of an organization, or devoting their lives to a cause, still have an impact through their volunteerism. Whether it be through donating to charitable organizations,
        spending some time helping out at the local library or shelter, donating blood, or even just taking the time to recycle. Whenever we go out of our way to do something for the greater good, we are volunteering.</p>
      <p>In this day and age, technology has furthered the impact that an ordinary volunteer can have. Take Wikipedia, an online information database run and edited purely by volunteers. It might not be the most reliable source of information, but it
        offers facts on almost any topic imaginable. This wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without contributions from everyday people, volunteering knowledge on something they know a lot about. In addition to Wikipedia, some other things, such as saving
        the environment, cannot be done solely by volunteer groups like the Red Cross or Lions, or by visionaries like those mentioned before. We can only achieve an impact of that proportion if all of humanity steps up and volunteers to help.</p>
      <p>To conclude, volunteerism isn&rsquo;t a straight, one-way pipe with a single group of volunteers flowing in one end, and a unified impact coming out the other side. Instead, it&rsquo;s akin to a tree. There are many different paths to
        volunteering, just as there are many different roots to a tree. Some are big, like service abroad through an organization or joining the armed forces. Some are smaller, like donating blood or community service. That being said, all the roots
        bring resources back to the same tree, but on that tree, there are thousands of branches. In correlation, there are thousands of impacts caused by volunteerism. Is it a cleaner, greener Earth, improved sanitary conditions for those in
        developing countries, or good food and clean water being available for those in need?</p>
      <p>These impacts are as numerous as the stars, but they all fall in the same category - supporting a cause. Volunteers are the fighters and warriors and soldiers, not just of armies, but of all causes. They are the ones who make the impossible
        happen, the ones who take a silent cause and spin it into song. Without them, all causes are merely thoughts that aren&rsquo;t expressed, and words without action. Volunteerism brings causes to life and makes the world a better place, not
        just for one group of people, but for everyone. As volunteers, we can change the world, one cause at a time.</p>
